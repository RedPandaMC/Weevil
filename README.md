Mallard is a VS Code extension that turns GitHub Copilot's local usage logs into a live cost dashboard: today's spend, month-to-date, and a projected month-end total, broken down by model, surface, cost type, and repository. By default there's nothing to sign into and nothing to configure — install it, use Copilot, and watch the numbers update in real time. Connect GitHub billing later if you want the authoritative charge alongside Mallard's estimate.

Under the hood it's a DuckDB-backed dashboard with branch-aware spend tracking, programmable budget alerts, and an optional restriction popup when a budget runs out, all running locally. No telemetry is collected and no external accounts are required by default; GitHub sign-in and metric export are opt-in.

## What talks to the network

By default, Mallard reads only local log files and sends nothing anywhere. Two background reference fetches are unconditional (no user data is sent):

- **Pricing manifest** — the Copilot credit-multiplier table is fetched daily from `raw.githubusercontent.com/RelativelyUnknown/mallard/main/media/pricing-manifest.json`. Per-token model prices are fetched from OpenRouter's public `/api/v1/models` endpoint (LiteLLM's community price sheet as fallback).
- **Currency rates** — daily FX rates from `api.frankfurter.app` for display-currency conversion.

If you opt in to metric export, payloads are sent to your self-hosted server only. If you opt in to GitHub billing, the extension calls GitHub's billing API using your token.

## Quick start

1. Install from the Extensions view, or:

   ```bash
   code --install-extension RelativelyUnknown.mallard
   ```

2. Use Copilot and/or Claude Code normally. Mallard starts collecting right away.

3. Open the dashboard from the Mallard icon in the activity bar, or run
   "Mallard: Open Dashboard" from the Command Palette.

If the dashboard shows "not enough data", run "Mallard: Show Detected Log Path" to check,
and set `mallard.copilotLogPath` if needed.
